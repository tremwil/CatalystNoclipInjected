A noclip tool for Mirrors Edge Catalyst. Although I still need to polish some stuff in it and fix some bugs, it is very reliable. There is only one feature that is left unimplemented: being able to move the camera while the game is frozen.

# How to use it
There are two noclip modes: Real-time (RT) and Frozen-Time (FT). The first one allows you to move your camera around, but since the game is running while you are floating in the air you will sometimes die for no reason. The trick to use this mode without any hassle is to enable it while performing the crouch glitch. As for FT noclip, it freezes the game completely so it is much more stable. The disadvantages of this mode is that not only will the camera be frozen, but the game will not load unloaded areas as you approach them. If you want to change your speed, you can use the "Move Slower" and "Move Faster" hotkeys. To move around, use the keybindings you defined for the game (usually WASD). Use the key mapped to jump to go up and the one mapped to crouch to go down. To change the current noclip mode, use the "Switch Mode" hotkey. To set noclip on/off, use the "Toggle Noclip" one.
